## projects (small tiles)

Each tile consists of a section, header, and img. Each section tile is a clickable link to the image file as there is no body of work to show off. 
The section header is an aside element.

## footer
The footer contains working links to the authors LinkedIn, Github, and email account. A telephone number has been listed but is not linked to being called.

## Media Properties

When hover over each tile the image will shift to half opacity.
